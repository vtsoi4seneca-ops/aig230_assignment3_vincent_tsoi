    "### What is smoothing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoothing is a way to stop a language model from saying “this can never happen.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a language model from data, it only knows what it has seen before.\n",
    "If it never saw a particular word sequence, the model would normally give it a probability of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoothing fixes that.\n",
    "### Why is this a problem without smoothing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the model learned English only by reading a small number of news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it never saw:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “oil prices explode”\n",
    "\n",
    "the model would conclude:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “That sentence is impossible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But as humans, we know it could happen. The model just hasn’t seen it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without smoothing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One unseen word makes the whole sentence probability zero\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluation breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is too confident and too brittle"
